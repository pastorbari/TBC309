    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a top-to-bottom guided journey, transforming the linear worksheet into an interactive experience. It begins with an introduction, presents the full prayer for context, and then moves into the core interactive section. This core section uses a tab-based navigation for the five "Thoughts" of the prayer. This design was chosen to break down the content into manageable, focused steps, preventing user overwhelm and encouraging deliberate reflection on each part. The user can navigate between thoughts non-linearly, but the layout encourages a sequential progression. Each tab reveals explanations, reflection questions, and a dedicated text area for the user to write their own prayer, making the activity personal and engaging. A final summary concludes the experience. This structure enhances usability by making the content digestible and interactive, directly supporting the source material's goal of teaching prayer through guided practice. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source material is entirely qualitative and textual. Therefore, no data charts are needed. The primary "visualization" is the structural layout itself, designed to guide the user's focus. Report Info: Five "Thoughts" of the Prayer -> Goal: Organize & Engage -> Presentation Method: Interactive Tabbed Sections (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: User clicks a tab to reveal content and types into a textarea. -> Justification: This transforms a static worksheet into an active, personal reflection tool. It focuses the user on one concept at a time for deeper engagement. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript for tab functionality and DOM manipulation. -> CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    Prayer is a powerful way to connect with God, express our gratitude, share our concerns, and seek guidance. Sometimes, knowing what to say or how to start can be challenging. Jesus provided a model prayer to teach us how to approach God. This interactive guide will walk you through the Lord's Prayer, breaking it down into complete thoughts to help you apply its principles in your own prayer life. Our goal is to develop a deeper, more meaningful prayer practice.
